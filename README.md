A clean, modern, and fully responsive weather application built with vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to search for any city and get real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## ## Features & Qualities

This project showcases a range of modern web development practices:

* **üì± Fully Responsive Design:** The interface adapts beautifully to any screen size, from small mobile phones to large desktops. This is achieved using a mobile-first approach with flexible units and media queries.

* **üíß Fluid Typography & Layout:** Text and elements scale smoothly with the screen size thanks to modern CSS features like the `clamp()` function and a robust Flexbox layout.

* **üåê Real-Time Weather Data:** Fetches up-to-the-minute weather information from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) using asynchronous JavaScript (Async/Await).

* **üîê Secure API Key Handling:** The API key is kept private and secure. It is stored in a `config.js` file which is excluded from the repository via `.gitignore` to prevent public exposure.

* **üå¶Ô∏è Dynamic Icons:** The main weather icon changes dynamically based on the current weather conditions (e.g., Clear, Clouds, Rain, Snow).

* **üß© Well-Structured Code:** The project follows best practices for file organization, with separate folders for CSS, JavaScript, and assets, making the codebase clean and easy to maintain.

## ## Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Structured with semantic tags for better accessibility.
* **CSS3:** Styled with modern features like Flexbox, Custom Properties (variables), and `clamp()`.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Powers the application's logic, API fetching, and dynamic content updates.
